## Main goals
1. Measure how many words are in an audio stream/file.
2. Who is the speaker? Adult or child.
3. Content of the sentence. Is it a sentence, is it a question?

## Other goals
1. Quantify when and whether a child likes or dislikes aspects.

## Dependencies for python3
All the requirements of the project can be install via a single command:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

a virutal environment is recommend to avoid package conflict and to avoid wrong python version.
